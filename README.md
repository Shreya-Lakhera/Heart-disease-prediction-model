This dataset provides information on the personal data and risks assessed for heart disease.
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. 
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
Attributes are:
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

(The dataset is taken from kaggle and can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/)

It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
